The work in this repository was completed for the GEN BUS 746 - Advanced SQL & Data Warehousing final project at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

The .sql file created databases, performed an ELT process on data, and contains various queries to answer business questions. 

More details about the project are found in the instructions .pdf.
