Using Python, I analyzed two years of scooter rental data and built a prediction model for rentals based on outside temperature. The code is written in a Jupyter notebook with markdown describing each step. 

I summarized the findings - that temperature alone does not lead to a very accurate prediction - and recommended adding other variables like wind and "feels like" temperature to create a more accurate model.
